use if you haven't tried them yet üôÇ

If you're an IBMer, we have a couple of Slack channels available across all IBM
Workspaces:

- #iot-pal for questions about the Watson IoT Pattern and Asset Library (PAL)
- #iot-pal-components for questions about components, usage of this repository

If these resources don't work out, help us out by filling in the details below.
