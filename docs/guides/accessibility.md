# Accessibility

The `carbon-addons-iot-react` project cares about accessibility. We have incorporated IBM's AVT automated testing tools to our CI pipeline to ensure, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that components are accessible. Components also go through a manual accessibility check to catch things that are not possible with automation. We acknowledge there may still be gaps surfaced during accessibility verification in product applications. With this, we welcome contributions to ensure as a community the resources provided here meet the needs of all consuming product teams.
