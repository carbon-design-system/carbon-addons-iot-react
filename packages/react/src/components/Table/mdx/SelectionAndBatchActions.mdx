## Selection and batch actions

The `Table` component supports both single and multiple row selection modes with the use of the prop
`options.hasRowSelection`. Once the user selects at least one row from the table in multi selection
mode, the batch action bar appears at the top of the table, presenting the user with actions they can take.

### Selections

The `options.hasRowSelection` can be turned on using either the value `single` for single row selection or `multi`
for multiple row selection. By default all rows are selectable but they can individually be made
unselectable by setting the row data object's `isSelectable` property to false.
A table with hasRowSelection `multi` will automatically add checkboxes in front of each row using
a extra column. For the StatefulTable the management of the the checkbox states are handled automatically,
but the prop `view.table.selectedIds` can still be used to set the initial selection.

```jsx
...

const preventSelection = (row) =>
  row.values.status === 'RUNNING' ? { ...row, isSelectable: false } : row;

return (
  <StatefulTable
    id="table"
    columns={columns}
    data={data.map(preventSelections)}
    options={{
      hasRowSelection: 'multi',
    }}
    view={{
      table: {
        selectedIds: ['row-4'],
      },
    }}
  />
);
```

### Batch actions

Batch actions are functions that may be performed on multiple rows within a table. All batch actions are
presented in a bar that temporarily hides the toolbar. By default the bar contains a "Cancel" button and
clicking it in the StatefulTable will clear all selections and close the batch action bar. Deselecting all
the selected rows will also close the batch actions bar. Additional batch actions can be added using the prop
`view.toolbar.batchActions` which accepts an array of objects used to define the action as shown in the
example below. All explicitly defined batch actions need to be handled programatically except for the 'delete' action
which is handled automatically by the StatefulTable.

```jsx
<StatefulTable
  id="table"
  columns={columns}
  data={data}
  actions={{
    toolbar: {
      // The onApplyBatchAction is used for all batch actions.
      // The actionId is the string id of the action being triggered,
      // and and the rowIds is an array with the ids if the rows the
      // action was performed on.
      onApplyBatchAction: (actionId, rowIds) => {
        // Implement your actions here
      },
    },
  }}
  options={{ hasRowSelection: 'multi' }}
  view={{
    table: {
      toolbar: {
        batchActions: [
          {
            // Adding an action with id 'delete' will tell the StatefulTable to
            // delete all the selected rows when the action is called.
            id: 'delete',
            labelText: 'Delete',
            renderIcon: TrashCan16,
            iconDescription: 'Delete Item',
          },
          {
            id: 'createActivity',
            labelText: 'Create activity',
            renderIcon: Activity16,
            iconDescription: 'Create activity from item',
          },
          {
            id: 'process',
            labelText: 'Process',
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  }}
/>
```

### Programmatic selection and batch actions

For the normal `Table` the callbacks and states of the selections and batch actions must be managed
programmatically, inlcuding the Cancel and Delete callbacks. You can set which rows are currently selected
through the `view.table.selectedIds` prop. This prop takes an array of selected row ids.
There are props that let you set the state of the "select all" checkbox explicitly but that is normally
not needed since it will be set automaticaly based on the selectedIds prop and the
actual rows of the table. If the table has nested rows it will also automatically show the correct selected
and indeterminate state of a parent row based on its children.

The following code example shows how to implement the "delete" and "cancel" batch action using the normal Table.

```jsx
...

const [selectedIds, setSelecteIds] = useState([]);
const [data, setData] = useState(initialData);

return (
  <Table
    id="table"
    columns={columns}
    data={data}
    actions={{
      toolbar: {
        // Cancel the action, and unselect all currently selected rows
        onCancelBatchAction: () => {
          setSelecteIds([]);
        },
        // Apply correct action using the actionId string
        // ActionId is the string id of the action being completed,
        // The StatefulTable also receives the current selections as a second argument.
        onApplyBatchAction: (actionId) => {
          if (actionId === 'delete') {
            setData((currentData) => currentData.filter(({ id }) => !selectedIds.includes(id)));
            setSelecteIds([]);
          }
        },
      },
      table: {
        // RowId is a string, selected is a boolean, selectedIds contain the new selection state.
        // If all child rows of a parent row are selected the last event's selectedIds param will also
        // contain the id of the now automatically selected parent.
        onRowSelected: (rowId, selected, selectedIds) => {
          setSelecteIds(selectedIds);
        },
        // AllSelected is a boolean which is true when all are selected, false otherwise
        onSelectAll: (allSelected) => {
          const newSelection = allSelected ? data.map(({ id }) => id) : [];
          setSelecteIds(newSelection);
        },
      },
    }}
    options={{ hasRowSelection: 'multi' }}
    view={{
      toolbar: {
        batchActions: [
          {
            id: 'delete',
            labelText: 'Delete',
            renderIcon: TrashCan16,
            iconDescription: 'Delete Item',
          },
        ],
      },
      table: {
        selectedIds,
      },
    }}
  />
);
```
